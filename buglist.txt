Adding and removing a ton of objects over and over ends up with some objects getting "lost" by the object manager. The components think the object exists but it doesn't.

The edges of terrain tiles normals don't quite line up. You can see a small line on the edge of tiles if you look closely.

The object scene graph doesn't correctly prune empty nodes if objects leave the graph from the bottom. Probably related to bug 1.
